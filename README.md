ðŸ§  Tech Breakdown:

HTML: Structured all the input fields (Title, Price, Taxes, Discount, Count, Category), buttons (Create, Search), and product display table.

CSS: Designed a modern, dark-themed user interface with interactive buttons and layout using Flexbox/Grid.

JavaScript (Vanilla):

Captured and validated user inputs through the DOM

Calculated total prices dynamically as the user types

Stored product data in the browserâ€™s Local Storage to persist even after refresh

Enabled CRUD operations on each product

Integrated real-time search functionality with filters

Automatically updates the UI upon any interaction (create/update/delete)

ðŸ’¡ Why I Built It:

I wanted to deepen my understanding of core JavaScript concepts like:

DOM manipulation

Working with arrays/objects

Managing state in the frontend

LocalStorage and data persistence


This project helped me connect theory with practical implementation.
